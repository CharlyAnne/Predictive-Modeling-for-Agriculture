# Crop Feature Selection â€” Predicting the Best Crop with Minimal Data
## Project Overview
A farmer reached out seeking help in selecting the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, he could only afford to measure one out of the following four essential soil features:
- Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
- Potassium content ratio in the soil
- pH value of the soil

This is a classic feature selection problem:
- Which single feature is the most important for accurately predicting the crop to grow?
- By solving this, the farmer can save costs while still making data-driven agricultural decisions.

## Objectives
- Identify the most important soil feature that predicts the crop type.
- Reduce measurement costs without significantly compromising prediction accuracy.
- Build an interpretable machine learning model for decision-making.
